### I'm Filip

<br/>
I'm a "Crypto-Native" developer, had a chance to use Ethereum and develop professionally on it before I had a chance to open a bank account or legally drink beer :)

Previously a DeFi builder, now building Protocols.
You canâ€™t build great things without a great foundation, we should scale Ethereum first and allow builders to build.
